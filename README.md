This tool is my attempt to understand and sort the landscape of people, organizations and businesses who are working to increase bicycle ridership in the US. I hope you will find it useful, and that you might provide feedback and input to make it better.

I've sorted work into high-level categories called "Strategies", followed by more specific categories called "Approaches". When you click on each, you will some examples of efforts being done in this area, and related media coverage. If the way I have organized information doesn't feel quite right, please submit feedback to let me know!

It's all HTML, CSS & Javascript - everything is in on HTML file because I couldn't get it to work with a separate js file. 

The tool relies on data hosted in Airtable - a super cool tool that makes it easy to work with a database.
